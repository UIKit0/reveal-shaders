==================


This is a <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/" target="_blank">reveal.js</a> presentation which uses <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/csscustomfilters" target="_blank">CSS Custom Filters</a> for transitions between slides.

At present you must use <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/csscustomfilters/" target="_blank">Google Chrome Canary</a> to view the CSS Custom Filters.

Right now, the custom filter transitions are only used for the top level navigation.  When you want to navigate down a stack and one of the CSS Custom Filter transitions is acive, the box transition is used instead to differentiate.
