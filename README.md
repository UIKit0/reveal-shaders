reveal-shaders
==================

This is a [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/){:target="_blank"} presentation which uses [CSS Custom Filters](http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/csscustomfilters/) for transitions between slides.

At present you must use [Chrome Canary](http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/csscustomfilters/) to view the CSS Custom Filters.

Right now, the custom filter transitions are only used for the top level navigation.  When you want to navigate down a stack and one of the CSS Custom Filter transitions is acive, the box transition is used instead to differentiate.

Enjoy!
